I am using this phone for almost 9 months. It is good smartphone. I am using many apps but phone does not hang. It is very good for rough and tough use. However camera quality is not good that’s why one star less.Only disappointment for me is camera otherwise the phone is all rounder

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

I am using it for almost 3-4 months. It's overall performance is upto the mark.BATTERY - FOR HEAVY GAMES LIKE FREE FIRE, IT HAS A BACKUP OF ALMOST 5 HOURS (100-20)%.  OTHERWISE , IT PROVIDES SCREEN TIME OF 8-9 HOURS.PROCESSOR - DECENT PERFORMAMCE IN PLAYING GAMES. OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

Little bit costly as features consider, back camera is not like 64mp its like 48mp but good in this price range , front camera is ok .speed is good , screen is good ,charging speed  is an average not like 33w .its 18-20 watt, display is good,  before you made any judgment youbhave to adjust settings according to your choiceIf you are gamer this phone is not for you , otherwise its good for general purpose .Flash is ok, looking wise great , lightweight .Doesn't hangs ,reading mode ,bedtime mode ,google dialer and sms app pre-installed.,dedicated sd card slot available. If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"

MI perfectly made this product. Battery life is good. Advance technology used i.e- Fast charging. Fingerprint and Iris scanner. Rear camera is too good compare to Front.I am not satisfied with front camera only. Because of front camera click is not good otherwise no complaint regarding mobile. Please buy it .

Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
582,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
591,"
Awesome  mobile
"

for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality

Overall phone is very good with fast response good camera. Only thing I noticed so far is that fingers sensor work even phone is not in use and kept inside the pocket. Due to this finger sensor gets disable again and again.

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.
"
635,"
Very good product
"

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
638,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"

Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Kuch badiya nhi h 5 month bad ye apni aukat pr aa jata h.... Har match main frame drops.... Gyroscope control nhi hota pura mobile hang ho jata h.... Game khelte time 1 normal wp ka notification bhi sambhal nhi pata..... 🥲

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
767,"
Well done phone
"
768,"
Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good
"

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.
"

I like redmi brand But this mobile made me upset.... Waste mobile too much struck while using... too much Heat camera also not good. Don't Buy it... Better go for other mobile Brands...
"
771,"
Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

The phone is very good but battery drains very very fastSpecially display and camera both are upto the mark.Good Sound QualityAverage fromt cameraSuper Amoled display awesomeit feels like a premium onebut the battery 5000 mah is not as long lasting as expectedand 33 watt fast charger..... hhhhuuuuuhhhhhtaking 2 hours and 25 minutes to charge 5% to 100%so is it called fast charger...?????battery back up is up to 15 hours for average users.
"

Phone is good... But camera quality very worst... Battery life also worst.
"

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

On Rs 12,500 this is good phone, if you need good camera then not buy

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

 Not good performance facing over heating in Daily task in one day use and the camera is totally waste in this price of range other phones and facing drop frame of rate in playing video. Lots of bug facing in this phone
"
829,"
This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels.

Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.

""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

I got my mobile delivered yesterday.I bought it to gift to my dad on his birthday.I was expecting a good quality screen as they said it's AMOLED. But really disappointed.It's not even as normal LED screen.Camera quality is very poor.Selfie camera is horrible. Camera hangs a lot during captureBattery utilisation is too much with normal usageAnd I don't see that great charging with the given adaptor as said in the reviews and description.With no memory filling, the phone started hanging.not sure how it works in future.Overall, I'm disappointed with the phone

Redmi 10S मोबाइल फोन बहुत ही हैंग हो रहा है, वीडियो चलाने पर वीडियो प्ले नही होती, app ओपन नहीं होते और भी बहुत सी प्रॉब्लम को इस हैंडसेट के साथ फेस कर रहे हैं। आप सभी को में यही सुझाव दूंगा की इस सेट को ना खरीदें।

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

 Phone has a great spec. I was looking for real 8Gig RAM phone under 15k segment. Got 8+4(Virtual) RAM. 128 G memory. Decent camera. solid Battery, takes only 30-40% battery on heavy use. Compared to my current phone Pro Max came weight is lighter.. Able to hold hoe long hours with good pop ups... Overall 7/10...

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Adding this review after 15 days of usage.Have purchased this phone for my father's birthday1.) Overall a good phone.2.) No lag issue3.) Batter is also good4.) Camera quality is okay as per the 10K phone range. You cannot expect iPhone like camera quality.5.) Look is good6.) No issues are faced as of now.Will update this after a few months of usage.
"
1485,"
Same as other Mi phones. Not so much different. Camera quality is not that much good.
"
1486,"
Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

I haven't found any heating and hanging issues yet.I am having only one problem.There is vibration at the time of typing. I can't find the option to turn it off.you can go for it. I bought this phone in 12999 rupees in offer period with cash on delivery. Thanks seller, thanks Amazon.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
1517,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent
"

Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
1522,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"
1553,"
Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"

MI perfectly made this product. Battery life is good. Advance technology used i.e- Fast charging. Fingerprint and Iris scanner. Rear camera is too good compare to Front.I am not satisfied with front camera only. Because of front camera click is not good otherwise no complaint regarding mobile. Please buy it .

"
1581,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
1582,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.

I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

I don't understand why it was so hyped I bought it by reading the reviews but it turned out to be a waste of money it's not at all good phone selfie camera is the worst one and back camera I didn't expect this from this phone.. Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"

Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
1939,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
1940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

Brought it for my mom and I exchanged my old device for this. I liked the larger screen size, big battery life and the sound is awesome. Overall a worthy product for the price I paid.

I am using it for almost 3-4 months. It's overall performance is upto the mark.BATTERY - FOR HEAVY GAMES LIKE FREE FIRE, IT HAS A BACKUP OF ALMOST 5 HOURS (100-20)%.  OTHERWISE , IT PROVIDES SCREEN TIME OF 8-9 HOURS.PROCESSOR - DECENT PERFORMAMCE IN PLAYING GAMES. OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000
"

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Camera quality is worst. Really disgusting experience after ecxhanging my 7pro for this... Camera quality was way better from this... Battery life is good... Fast charging is good.. Fingerprint sensor works quick... But if you are a photography enthusiastic then don't go for this

Phone is superb. I'm using this phone 3 months and have no lag issues in UI. But during BGMI gameplay, there's so much lag🙂. And I Didn't get the built in Alexa as promised. Battery is good, Camera decent, Display is superb 🤩

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display. In display fingerprint should include in place of side fingerprint.My Rating after 5 days of usedFront Camera - 3/5Rare Camera - 4.5/5Processor - 4.7/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Battery Life - 4/5Charging Speed - 5/5Sound Quality - 5/5 (for Dual Speaker)Display Quality - 5/5 (for Amoled Display)Design - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5 ( 14000 is good)Improvement in Front camera and in display fingerprint.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.

Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus.

Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.

MI perfectly made this product. Battery life is good. Advance technology used i.e- Fast charging. Fingerprint and Iris scanner.

Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
2582,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"

Awesome  mobile

for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality

Overall phone is very good with fast response good camera. Only thing I noticed so far is that fingers sensor work even phone is not in use and kept inside the pocket. Due to this finger sensor gets disable again and again.

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.
"

Very good product
"

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
2638,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
2728,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"

Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

The phone is very good but battery drains very very fastSpecially display and camera both are upto the mark.Good Sound QualityAverage fromt cameraSuper Amoled display awesomeit feels like a premium onebut the battery 5000 mah is not as long lasting as expectedand 33 watt fast charger..... hhhhuuuuuhhhhhtaking 2 hours and 25 minutes to charge 5% to 100%so is it called fast charger...?????battery back up is up to 15 hours for average users.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

On Rs 12,500 this is good phone, if you need good camera then not buy

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

The phone as expected has heating issues,but the performance till now is kinda ok...bought this like 28 days ago..charger stopped working the day before yesterday itself...about the phone if you wanna know my feedback it is performing good for the things i use it for...i also play a game called free fire and it provides good sensitivity and touch responce as well...i play in standard and i see no lag even with screen rec on so it can allow you to do some good movements as well as headshots...but that stupid charger man..im pissed about that...please dont sell crappy side products...from some experience i saw that nobody gets a charger like the original one..please provide good side products too

"
2829,"
This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels.

Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
2939,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
2940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

Dears, The mobile is handy but battery consumption to system app is more than other mobile. Installed alexa, it dried battery to 80percent in just 3 hrs. But charger works well. Amlod display is not upto the mark and consumes more battery. Sond effect without earphones is not so effective as expected. Other issue and pros will be shortly submitted.

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

Overall phone is not that good. Multiple issue, like camera is not that good. Call drop issue (not related to simcard). Wifi connection issue, slowness in application switching and few more. Overall, not a very good product. Note 9, 8 were far better than this mode.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money. If you are looking for a good phone in a reasonable price range- this one tops it. The camera works well. Features are good and updated and phone has a good quality.reviewing after using for 2 months :)

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

Achha mobile hai, bahut achha chal raha hai
"
3515,"
Camera is below average, slowness and lag observed in normal operations.
"
3516,"
I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
3517,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent
"
3521,"
Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
3522,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.
"
3535,"
One of the best phone in this price segment look is awesome

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"
3553,"
Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

MI perfectly made this product. Battery life is good. Advance technology used i.e- Fast charging. Fingerprint and Iris scanner.

Everything is tooooo good except camera ,, camera is good in outdoor condition and i loved  the display
"
3580,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
3581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..
"
3582,"
It his very good battry life not the best cameraBut very good for its price
"

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
3590,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
3591,"
Awesome  mobile
"
3592,"
for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality
"

"
3608,"

Camera is decent but not great. Battery is very good. Overall UI is good but there are some restrictions. Call recording without notifying the other side is not possible in this. Good phone overall.
"
3610,"
Overall phone is very good with fast response good camera. Only thing I noticed so far is that fingers sensor work even phone is not in use and kept inside the pocket. Due to this finger sensor gets disable again and again.
"

It was just camera which didn't meet up my expectations.Otherwise i was amazed when i saw that Redmi also tried to provide the stock Android feel.And camera is not too bad, you won't get perfect everything in just Rs 15k
"
3633,"
In this price range best device, all over best performance like battery backup, processor speed, Network...
"
3634,"
Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.
"
3635,"
Very good product
"
3636,"
This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"
3637,"
i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
3638,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"
3639,"
Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.
"

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

I love the quality of the product and it's was very good accessibility in all the feature, camera quality it is very good function but some part of photography level it has alot of grains and photo are not looking really good. I have also experience the back glass of the camera is bit broken but when I try to return the product it seem like there's no option but asking to install diagnostic apk which is not satisfying to other customer to buy the product.

"
3727,"
Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
3767,"
Well done phone

3768,"
Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good
"
3769,"
I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.
"

I like redmi brand But this mobile made me upset.... Waste mobile too much struck while using... too much Heat camera also not good. Don't Buy it... Better go for other mobile Brands...
"

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
3772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
3940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Writing this after using for 4 months:-The handset is good and if u want to be in budget friendly then u can go for itPros:-Battery lifeAmoled display (impressed with it)Built qualityCons:-camera quality both fornt and back can be better in this budget segment (not as good as claimed in the discription)Overall it's a nice mobile. if camera is not a prior concern then go for it. Best for entertainment and gaming

Screen quality and sound quality are very good. Camera is okay, cant expect much for this price range. The interface is pretty smooth. No issues with the battery, with heavy usage we can get it till the end of day.  Overall its a good.

"

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000
"

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Was worries at first by reading negative revieww but now fully satisfied with the purchase, camera is not upto mark as a 64mp quad camera sometimes pics are too blur while using snapchat specially, performance is upto mark till now cant say about future, battery is also good,Point is u can buy this phone according to seeing the price and the features , it is a good phone🤔

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

The camera quality of this phone, specially the front camera is not worth the money.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

Fingerprint reader is working fine after 3 weeks of usage, camera quality could have been better, battery life is ok there is fast charger so if the mobile in 60% charge it for 20 mins it will be 90% approx. or near

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

Very poor camera quality

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Adding this review after 15 days of usage.Have purchased this phone for my father's birthday1.) Overall a good phone.2.) No lag issue3.) Batter is also good4.) Camera quality is okay as per the 10K phone range. You cannot expect iPhone like camera quality.5.) Look is good6.) No issues are faced as of now.Will update this after a few months of usage.
"
4484,"
Same as other Mi phones. Not so much different. Camera quality is not that much good.
"
4485,"
Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
4517,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent

Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
4522,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
4581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
4590,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"

I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
4728,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
4772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

On Rs 12,500 this is good phone, if you need good camera then not buy

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

The phone as expected has heating issues,but the performance till now is kinda ok...bought this like 28 days ago..charger stopped working the day before yesterday itself...about the phone if you wanna know my feedback it is performing good for the things i use it for...i also play a game called free fire and it provides good sensitivity and touch responce as well...i play in standard and i see no lag even with screen rec on so it can allow you to do some good movements as well as headshots...but that stupid charger man..im pissed about that...please dont sell crappy side products...from some experience i saw that nobody gets a charger like the original one..please provide good side products too

"

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
4939,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
4940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

Hi.I've brought Redmi note 10s from Amazon 13 days before. Everything is fine expect the speaker of the phone. Issue is when I play songs there's an inturreption in between..Is there any way where I can exchange this one with another?I hope I'll get the response from Amazon team regarding this.

OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display. In display fingerprint should include in place of side fingerprint.My Rating after 5 days of usedFront Camera - 3/5Rare Camera - 4.5/5Processor - 4.7/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Battery Life - 4/5Charging Speed - 5/5Sound Quality - 5/5 (for Dual Speaker)Display Quality - 5/5 (for Amoled Display)Design - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5 ( 14000 is good)Improvement in Front camera and in display fingerprint.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset.

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

MI perfectly made this product. Battery life is good. Advance technology used i.e- Fast charging. Fingerprint and Iris scanner. Rear camera is too good compare to Front.I am not satisfied with front camera only. Because of front camera click is not good otherwise no complaint regarding mobile. Please buy it .

Everything is tooooo good except camera ,, camera is good in outdoor condition and i loved  the display
"
5580,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
5581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..
"
5582,"
It his very good battry life not the best cameraBut very good for its price
"

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
5590,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
5591,"
Awesome  mobile
"
5592,"
for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality
"

Camera is decent but not great. Battery is very good. Overall UI is good but there are some restrictions. Call recording without notifying the other side is not possible in this. Good phone overall.
"
5610,"
Overall phone is very good with fast response good camera. Only thing I noticed so far is that fingers sensor work even phone is not in use and kept inside the pocket. Due to this finger sensor gets disable again and again.

In this price range best device, all over best performance like battery backup, processor speed, Network...
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.
"
5635,"
Very good product
"
5636,"
This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"
5637,"
i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
5638,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"
5639,"
Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.

But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
5728,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Pro's1. Screen2. Average battery life3. Good for light gaming like free fireCon's1. Battery life is not enough for heavy gamers2. Camera quality is average..... Photos lack details....3.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
5767,"
Well done phone
"
5768,"
Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good
"
5769,"
I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.
"

I like redmi brand But this mobile made me upset.... Waste mobile too much struck while using... too much Heat camera also not good. Don't Buy it... Better go for other mobile Brands...
"

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
5772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.
"

Camera quality missing

The phone is ok, but delivery was late. Amazon failed to deliver the order once and without any fault of mine I was asked to cancel the order and place it again. Phone is ok but delivery service pathetic in terms of timeliness

The phone is very good but battery drains very very fastSpecially display and camera both are upto the mark.Good Sound QualityAverage fromt cameraSuper Amoled display awesomeit feels like a premium onebut the battery 5000 mah is not as long lasting as expectedand 33 watt fast charger..... hhhhuuuuuhhhhhtaking 2 hours and 25 minutes to charge 5% to 100%so is it called fast charger...?????battery back up is up to 15 hours for average users.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
5940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.
"

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

This mobile is amazing but sometimes it's temperature rises. But Battery life is good and charging 🔋⚡ speed is very Good. In 30/45 min it charged full. So if you want to buy a Phone like this So this is a Good choice but only problem is Heating very much if you call About 30 min then also it heats too much. I don't know why but heating problem I am facing and fingerprint and camera is Real. Storage is good in this Budget.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Adding this review after 15 days of usage.Have purchased this phone for my father's birthday1.) Overall a good phone.2.) No lag issue3.) Batter is also good4.) Camera quality is okay as per the 10K phone range. You cannot expect iPhone like camera quality.5.) Look is good6.) No issues are faced as of now.Will update this after a few months of usage.
"
6484,"
Same as other Mi phones. Not so much different. Camera quality is not that much good.
"
6485,"
Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

I haven't found any heating and hanging issues yet.I am having only one problem.There is vibration at the time of typing. I can't find the option to turn it off.you can go for it. I bought this phone in 12999 rupees in offer period with cash on delivery. Thanks seller, thanks Amazon.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

Camera is below average, slowness and lag observed in normal operations.
"

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
6516,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent
"

Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
6521,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"
6553,"
Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

"
6580,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
6581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

It his very good battry life not the best cameraBut very good for its price

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
6590,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
6591,"
Awesome  mobile

for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality

In this price range best device, all over best performance like battery backup, processor speed, Network...
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
6638,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

I don't understand why it was so hyped I bought it by reading the reviews but it turned out to be a waste of money it's not at all good phone selfie camera is the worst one and back camera I didn't expect this from this phone.. Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
6728,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
6772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

Although the screen is definitely the good part here! But camera is not so good it's just average camera in this price range .. as the performance is balanced per battery usage !Gaming is good there are few jitters ... But it's fine !

Product is good and function smoothly. But in order to that, the camera is not upto mark level. And the display is below average. While you buy the product, just consider the display. And apart from that it's okay..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
6939,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
6940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

Hi.I've brought Redmi note 10s from Amazon 13 days before. Everything is fine expect the speaker of the phone. Issue is when I play songs there's an inturreption in between..Is there any way where I can exchange this one with another?I hope I'll get the response from Amazon team regarding this.

It was awesome, really awesome display, awesome touch, awesome everything except, once you update to MIUI 13, you will start facing like 1000 issues. YouTube lags, dialer hangs when you receive call, WIFI dies and Touch will lag too. Just don't update MIUI 13

I am using it for almost 3-4 months. It's overall performance is upto the mark.BATTERY - FOR HEAVY GAMES LIKE FREE FIRE, IT HAS A BACKUP OF ALMOST 5 HOURS (100-20)%.  OTHERWISE , IT PROVIDES SCREEN TIME OF 8-9 HOURS.PROCESSOR - DECENT PERFORMAMCE IN PLAYING GAMES. OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000
"

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display. In display fingerprint should include in place of side fingerprint.My Rating after 5 days of usedFront Camera - 3/5Rare Camera - 4.5/5Processor - 4.7/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Battery Life - 4/5Charging Speed - 5/5Sound Quality - 5/5 (for Dual Speaker)Display Quality - 5/5 (for Amoled Display)Design - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5 ( 14000 is good)Improvement in Front camera and in display fingerprint.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

Everything is tooooo good except camera ,, camera is good in outdoor condition and i loved  the display
"
7580,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
7581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
7590,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
7591,"
Awesome  mobile
"

for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality

Overall phone is very good with fast response good camera. Only thing I noticed so far is that fingers sensor work even phone is not in use and kept inside the pocket. Due to this finger sensor gets disable again and again.

In this price range best device, all over best performance like battery backup, processor speed, Network...
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.
"
7635,"
Very good product
"

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"
7637,"
i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
7638,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"

Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
7728,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
7767,"
Well done phone
"
7768,"
Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good
"

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

I like redmi brand But this mobile made me upset.... Waste mobile too much struck while using... too much Heat camera also not good. Don't Buy it... Better go for other mobile Brands...
"

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
7772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.
"

The phone is ok, but delivery was late. Amazon failed to deliver the order once and without any fault of mine I was asked to cancel the order and place it again. Phone is ok but delivery service pathetic in terms of timeliness

The phone is very good but battery drains very very fastSpecially display and camera both are upto the mark.Good Sound QualityAverage fromt cameraSuper Amoled display awesomeit feels like a premium onebut the battery 5000 mah is not as long lasting as expectedand 33 watt fast charger..... hhhhuuuuuhhhhhtaking 2 hours and 25 minutes to charge 5% to 100%so is it called fast charger...?????battery back up is up to 15 hours for average users.

Phone is good... But camera quality very worst... Battery life also worst.
"

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

On Rs 12,500 this is good phone, if you need good camera then not buy

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

"
7828,"
This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light..

Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels.

Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"

""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

I got my mobile delivered yesterday.I bought it to gift to my dad on his birthday.I was expecting a good quality screen as they said it's AMOLED. But really disappointed.It's not even as normal LED screen.Camera quality is very poor.Selfie camera is horrible. Camera hangs a lot during captureBattery utilisation is too much with normal usageAnd I don't see that great charging with the given adaptor as said in the reviews and description.With no memory filling, the phone started hanging.not sure how it works in future.Overall, I'm disappointed with the phone

Redmi 10S मोबाइल फोन बहुत ही हैंग हो रहा है, वीडियो चलाने पर वीडियो प्ले नही होती, app ओपन नहीं होते और भी बहुत सी प्रॉब्लम को इस हैंडसेट के साथ फेस कर रहे हैं। आप सभी को में यही सुझाव दूंगा की इस सेट को ना खरीदें।

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

 Phone has a great spec. I was looking for real 8Gig RAM phone under 15k segment. Got 8+4(Virtual) RAM. 128 G memory. Decent camera. solid Battery, takes only 30-40% battery on heavy use. Compared to my current phone Pro Max came weight is lighter.. Able to hold hoe long hours with good pop ups... Overall 7/10...

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money. If you are looking for a good phone in a reasonable price range- this one tops it. The camera works well.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Adding this review after 15 days of usage.Have purchased this phone for my father's birthday1.) Overall a good phone.2.) No lag issue3.) Batter is also good4.) Camera quality is okay as per the 10K phone range. You cannot expect iPhone like camera quality.5.) Look is good6.) No issues are faced as of now.Will update this after a few months of usage.
"
8484,"
Same as other Mi phones. Not so much different. Camera quality is not that much good.
"
8485,"
Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

good phone.  Nice display, good camera, picture quality is very good.  Battery backup is so good.  This phone gets fully charged in just 1.20 hours.  No compromise with this phone. I haven't found any heating and hanging issues yet.I am having only one problem.There is vibration at the time of typing. I can't find the option to turn it off.you can go for it. I bought this phone in 12999 rupees in offer period with cash on delivery. Thanks seller, thanks Amazon.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
8516,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent
"

Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
8521,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"
8553,"
Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

"
8580,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
8581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

It his very good battry life not the best cameraBut very good for its price

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
8590,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.

I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.

But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

I don't understand why it was so hyped I bought it by reading the reviews but it turned out to be a waste of money it's not at all good phone selfie camera is the worst one and back camera I didn't expect this from this phone.. Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
8767,"
Well done phone

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
8772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
8939,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
8940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

I am using it for almost 3-4 months. It's overall performance is upto the mark.BATTERY - FOR HEAVY GAMES LIKE FREE FIRE, IT HAS A BACKUP OF ALMOST 5 HOURS (100-20)%.  OTHERWISE , IT PROVIDES SCREEN TIME OF 8-9 HOURS.PROCESSOR - DECENT PERFORMAMCE IN PLAYING GAMES. OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

Mobile is excellent , it would be a best option if you are a normal user, if a gamer check for better options, display is awesome and RAM management is decent, overal a worthy mobile to buy.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000
"

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Phone is superb. I'm using this phone 3 months and have no lag issues in UI. But during BGMI gameplay, there's so much lag🙂. And I Didn't get the built in Alexa as promised. Battery is good, Camera decent, Display is superb 🤩

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display. In display fingerprint should include in place of side fingerprint.My Rating after 5 days of usedFront Camera - 3/5Rare Camera - 4.5/5Processor - 4.7/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Battery Life - 4/5Charging Speed - 5/5Sound Quality - 5/5 (for Dual Speaker)Display Quality - 5/5 (for Amoled Display)Design - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5 ( 14000 is good)Improvement in Front camera and in display fingerprint.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.

Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

"

so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.

I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.

I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
9728,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"

Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

The phone is very good but battery drains very very fastSpecially display and camera both are upto the mark.Good Sound QualityAverage fromt cameraSuper Amoled display awesomeit feels like a premium onebut the battery 5000 mah is not as long lasting as expectedand 33 watt fast charger..... hhhhuuuuuhhhhhtaking 2 hours and 25 minutes to charge 5% to 100%so is it called fast charger...?????battery back up is up to 15 hours for average users.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

On Rs 12,500 this is good phone, if you need good camera then not buy

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

The phone as expected has heating issues,but the performance till now is kinda ok...bought this like 28 days ago..charger stopped working the day before yesterday itself...about the phone if you wanna know my feedback it is performing good for the things i use it for...i also play a game called free fire and it provides good sensitivity and touch responce as well...i play in standard and i see no lag even with screen rec on so it can allow you to do some good movements as well as headshots...but that stupid charger man..im pissed about that...please dont sell crappy side products...from some experience i saw that nobody gets a charger like the original one..please provide good side products too

 Not good performance facing over heating in Daily task in one day use and the camera is totally waste in this price of range other phones and facing drop frame of rate in playing video. Lots of bug facing in this phone
"
9828,"
This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels.

Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
9939,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
9940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

Dears, The mobile is handy but battery consumption to system app is more than other mobile. Installed alexa, it dried battery to 80percent in just 3 hrs. But charger works well. Amlod display is not upto the mark and consumes more battery. Sond effect without earphones is not so effective as expected. Other issue and pros will be shortly submitted.

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

Hi.I've brought Redmi note 10s from Amazon 13 days before. Everything is fine expect the speaker of the phone. Issue is when I play songs there's an inturreption in between..Is there any way where I can exchange this one with another?I hope I'll get the response from Amazon team regarding this.

OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

 Phone has a great spec. I was looking for real 8Gig RAM phone under 15k segment. Got 8+4(Virtual) RAM. 128 G memory. Decent camera. solid Battery, takes only 30-40% battery on heavy use. Compared to my current phone Pro Max came weight is lighter.. Able to hold hoe long hours with good pop ups... Overall 7/10...

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money. If you are looking for a good phone in a reasonable price range- this one tops it. The camera works well. Features are good and updated and phone has a good quality.reviewing after using for 2 months :)

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

I haven't found any heating and hanging issues yet.I am having only one problem.There is vibration at the time of typing. I can't find the option to turn it off.you can go for it. I bought this phone in 12999 rupees in offer period with cash on delivery. Thanks seller, thanks Amazon.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

Camera is below average, slowness and lag observed in normal operations.
"

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
10516,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent
"

Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
10521,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

"
10580,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
10581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
10590,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
10591,"
Awesome  mobile
"

for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
10637,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"
10638,"
Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.
"
10649,"
I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
10767,"
Well done phone

Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
10772,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
10940,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

OTHERWISE , IT PROVIDES SCREEN TIME OF 8-9 HOURS.PROCESSOR - DECENT PERFORMAMCE IN PLAYING GAMES. OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

Mobile is excellent , it would be a best option if you are a normal user, if a gamer check for better options, display is awesome and RAM management is decent, overal a worthy mobile to buy.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display. In display fingerprint should include in place of side fingerprint.My Rating after 5 days of usedFront Camera - 3/5Rare Camera - 4.5/5Processor - 4.7/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Battery Life - 4/5Charging Speed - 5/5Sound Quality - 5/5 (for Dual Speaker)Display Quality - 5/5 (for Amoled Display)Design - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5 ( 14000 is good)Improvement in Front camera and in display fingerprint.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

Happy with the product
"
11579,"
Everything is tooooo good except camera ,, camera is good in outdoor condition and i loved  the display
"
11580,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
11581,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"

I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
11591,"
Awesome  mobile
"

for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality

Overall phone is very good with fast response good camera. Only thing I noticed so far is that fingers sensor work even phone is not in use and kept inside the pocket. Due to this finger sensor gets disable again and again.

In this price range best device, all over best performance like battery backup, processor speed, Network...
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.
"
11634,"
Very good product
"
11635,"
This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"
11636,"
i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
11637,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"
11638,"
Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.
"

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal
"

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.
"

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
11728,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

I like redmi brand But this mobile made me upset.... Waste mobile too much struck while using... too much Heat camera also not good. Don't Buy it... Better go for other mobile Brands...

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more

Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

The phone is very good but battery drains very very fastSpecially display and camera both are upto the mark.Good Sound QualityAverage fromt cameraSuper Amoled display awesomeit feels like a premium onebut the battery 5000 mah is not as long lasting as expectedand 33 watt fast charger..... hhhhuuuuuhhhhhtaking 2 hours and 25 minutes to charge 5% to 100%so is it called fast charger...?????battery back up is up to 15 hours for average users.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

"

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light..

Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels.

Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"

""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

I got my mobile delivered yesterday.I bought it to gift to my dad on his birthday.I was expecting a good quality screen as they said it's AMOLED. But really disappointed.It's not even as normal LED screen.Camera quality is very poor.Selfie camera is horrible. Camera hangs a lot during captureBattery utilisation is too much with normal usageAnd I don't see that great charging with the given adaptor as said in the reviews and description.With no memory filling, the phone started hanging.not sure how it works in future.Overall, I'm disappointed with the phone

Redmi 10S मोबाइल फोन बहुत ही हैंग हो रहा है, वीडियो चलाने पर वीडियो प्ले नही होती, app ओपन नहीं होते और भी बहुत सी प्रॉब्लम को इस हैंडसेट के साथ फेस कर रहे हैं। आप सभी को में यही सुझाव दूंगा की इस सेट को ना खरीदें।

Dears, The mobile is handy but battery consumption to system app is more than other mobile. Installed alexa, it dried battery to 80percent in just 3 hrs. But charger works well. Amlod display is not upto the mark and consumes more battery. Sond effect without earphones is not so effective as expected. Other issue and pros will be shortly submitted.

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

This mobile is amazing but sometimes it's temperature rises. But Battery life is good and charging 🔋⚡ speed is very Good. In 30/45 min it charged full. So if you want to buy a Phone like this So this is a Good choice but only problem is Heating very much if you call About 30 min then also it heats too much. I don't know why but heating problem I am facing and fingerprint and camera is Real. Storage is good in this Budget.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Adding this review after 15 days of usage.Have purchased this phone for my father's birthday1.) Overall a good phone.2.) No lag issue3.) Batter is also good4.) Camera quality is okay as per the 10K phone range. You cannot expect iPhone like camera quality.5.) Look is good6.) No issues are faced as of now.Will update this after a few months of usage.
"

Same as other Mi phones. Not so much different. Camera quality is not that much good.

Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

I haven't found any heating and hanging issues yet.I am having only one problem.There is vibration at the time of typing. I can't find the option to turn it off.you can go for it. I bought this phone in 12999 rupees in offer period with cash on delivery. Thanks seller, thanks Amazon.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

Camera is below average, slowness and lag observed in normal operations.
"
12533,"
I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
12534,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent
"
12538,"
Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
12539,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"
12571,"
Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

"
12598,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
12599,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
12608,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
12609,"
Awesome  mobile

for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality

In this price range best device, all over best performance like battery backup, processor speed, Network...
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

Very good product
"

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
12655,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"
12656,"
Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

I don't understand why it was so hyped I bought it by reading the reviews but it turned out to be a waste of money it's not at all good phone selfie camera is the worst one and back camera I didn't expect this from this phone.. Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

12785,"
Well done phone

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"

Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

Product is good and function smoothly. But in order to that, the camera is not upto mark level. And the display is below average. While you buy the product, just consider the display. And apart from that it's okay..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
12957,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
12958,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Everything excellent except 12NM based processor and back of phone, which is polycarbonate and gets scratched easily, Don't use any hard case...Battery 4.5/5 considering 12NM G95 ProcessorCamera 4.3/5Charge speed-Good (Takes almost an Hour to complete charge)Display 4.6/5 Colour accuracy could have been better(brightness and everything else is superbbb)Looks 4.7/5 May vary for youResponsiveness 5/5Finger reader 6/5Gaming 3.7/5,Supports 60FPS BGMI default but I experienced major frame drops, IDK why, but other devices should perform well.Uninstall all bloatware via ADB to improve performance even further.Stay on MIUI 12.5, better than MIUI 13(As of now), switch to INDONASIA ROM from INDIA ROM for better results and for MIUI Dialer and Messaging Apps.Hope it help........

I am using this phone for almost 9 months. It is good smartphone. I am using many apps but phone does not hang. It is very good for rough and tough use. However camera quality is not good that’s why one star less.Only disappointment for me is camera otherwise the phone is all rounder

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

Hi.I've brought Redmi note 10s from Amazon 13 days before. Everything is fine expect the speaker of the phone. Issue is when I play songs there's an inturreption in between..Is there any way where I can exchange this one with another?I hope I'll get the response from Amazon team regarding this.

OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

"

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

Rare camera is so good but front camera should be improve. The best think is that 6.4 Inc full hd plus with Amoled display.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

MI perfectly made this product. Battery life is good. Advance technology used i.e- Fast charging. Fingerprint and Iris scanner. Rear camera is too good compare to Front.I am not satisfied with front camera only. Because of front camera click is not good otherwise no complaint regarding mobile. Please buy it .

Everything is tooooo good except camera ,, camera is good in outdoor condition and i loved  the display
"
13598,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
13599,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

Camera Quality very poor.Don't buy this phone
"

Touch is good but display refers rate is poor. Letter are shatterig when we scroll.Worst camera from xiomi. Even 2mp camera will do better. Totally dissatisfied.

Overall its a good phone but front camera is average fingerprint working well and a very good battery life but i very much disappointed at amazon delivery time they very much delayed to dispatch item

"
13606,"
Nice phone
"
13607,"
The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
13608,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
13609,"
Awesome  mobile
"
13610,"
for gaming it's good and charging also little faster, comfortable to hold and weight less, only issue is the camera quality
"
13611,"

Camera is clear, however colors are not very accurate. Battery life is good. Performance is good. Built quality is also good in this price range. Finger print side mounted sensor is not quick.

Pros-*Performance (supports 60 fps in cod &bgmi)*Battery (easily 1-2 day battery usage)*Display (very bright and punchy colours)*Charging (0-100 in 70 minutes)* Selfie cameraCONS-Video recording is decentBack camera is okay
"
13626,"
Not so good but in this price segment its good.
"
13627,"
Camera is decent but not great. Battery is very good. Overall UI is good but there are some restrictions. Call recording without notifying the other side is not possible in this. Good phone overall.
"
13628,"
Overall phone is very good with fast response good camera. Only thing I noticed so far is that fingers sensor work even phone is not in use and kept inside the pocket. Due to this finger sensor gets disable again and again.
"
13629,"
Camera is not up to the mark. Gaming performance could have been a bit better.

Fingerprint reader is actually fast and camera quality is super.But battery life is not good because playing BGMI and other games battery draining faster, battery performance is not good while playing games and heavy task.

It was just camera which didn't meet up my expectations.Otherwise i was amazed when i saw that Redmi also tried to provide the stock Android feel.And camera is not too bad, you won't get perfect everything in just Rs 15k
"
13650,"
In this price range best device, all over best performance like battery backup, processor speed, Network...
"
13651,"
Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.
"
13652,"
Very good product
"
13653,"
This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"
13654,"
i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
13655,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.
"
13656,"
Its usp is its superb screen and adequate RAM. Camera is good. All in all an all-rounder phone.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.
"

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal
"

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

I love the quality of the product and it's was very good accessibility in all the feature, camera quality it is very good function but some part of photography level it has alot of grains and photo are not looking really good. I have also experience the back glass of the camera is bit broken but when I try to return the product it seem like there's no option but asking to install diagnostic apk which is not satisfying to other customer to buy the product.

"
13745,"
Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"
13746,"
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Pro's1. Screen2. Average battery life3. Good for light gaming like free fireCon's1. Battery life is not enough for heavy gamers2. Camera quality is average..... Photos lack details....3.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
13785,"
Well done phone
"
13786,"
Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good
"
13787,"
I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.
"
13788,"
I like redmi brand But this mobile made me upset.... Waste mobile too much struck while using... too much Heat camera also not good. Don't Buy it... Better go for other mobile Brands...
"
13789,"
Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
13790,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.
"
13791,"
Camera quality missing

The phone is ok, but delivery was late. Amazon failed to deliver the order once and without any fault of mine I was asked to cancel the order and place it again. Phone is ok but delivery service pathetic in terms of timeliness

The phone is very good but battery drains very very fastSpecially display and camera both are upto the mark.Good Sound QualityAverage fromt cameraSuper Amoled display awesomeit feels like a premium onebut the battery 5000 mah is not as long lasting as expectedand 33 watt fast charger..... hhhhuuuuuhhhhhtaking 2 hours and 25 minutes to charge 5% to 100%so is it called fast charger...?????battery back up is up to 15 hours for average users.

Phone is good... But camera quality very worst... Battery life also worst.
"

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

"
13846,"
This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it.

I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

the only thing which is good is its sterio dual speaker and light wt. of mobile , except this nothing is good.for gaming of 1-2 hour continueous is too dangerous mobile got extreme heat.camera quality is average.display quality is not much better, better than fhd+ but not like other s- amoled.charging time is 1hr 15 min if not used during charging,if you use mobile during charging it take 2+ hour.overall , agood phone for study and normal use but u can go for 5g phone in this range if u want to take for future next 2-3 year

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
13958,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.
"

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Dears, The mobile is handy but battery consumption to system app is more than other mobile. Installed alexa, it dried battery to 80percent in just 3 hrs. But charger works well.

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Writing this after using for 4 months:-The handset is good and if u want to be in budget friendly then u can go for itPros:-Battery lifeAmoled display (impressed with it)Built qualityCons:-camera quality both fornt and back can be better in this budget segment (not as good as claimed in the discription)Overall it's a nice mobile. if camera is not a prior concern then go for it. Best for entertainment and gaming

Screen quality and sound quality are very good. Camera is okay, cant expect much for this price range. The interface is pretty smooth. No issues with the battery, with heavy usage we can get it till the end of day.  Overall its a good.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000
"

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

After 3 months - Performance is very good for day to day use. Camera is very worst oil painted effect is appearing when you slightly zoom the picture. 64 MP Omnivision camera sensor is used as main camera - worst quality. Battery is well and good - fast charging is decent. Display is superb. Audio quality is medium. More bugs in MIUI. Back is plastic and quality is poor.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

Camera quality is okay as per the 10K phone range. You cannot expect iPhone like camera quality.5.) Look is good6.) No issues are faced as of now.Will update this after a few months of usage.

Everything is ok except camera quality.1. Super Amoled Display is very good2. Battery & charging performance is  impressive3. Sound quality is also good4. Hand felling is comfortable5. Camera quality is also admirable in shiny  daylightBut***In night it captures very* poor quality pics...... I'm one of them who need a good camera phone but unfortunately it has not so good camera quality in night( <4 in day)So if you want a good camera phone you must go in another option otherwise Note 10S is excellent.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.

Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
14623,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
14632,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"

I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.

I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal
"

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.

But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.
"

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.

Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
14814,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

just wow.... when you use the touch screen you will feel the smoothness, now i regret why didn't I bought the MI mobile earlier instead was using the pathetic Realme brand, good thing about Xiaomi is we have lots and lots of advanced features like missed notification blinking lights on display, I really love that feature, overall I am really delighted 🙂

On Rs 12,500 this is good phone, if you need good camera then not buy

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

The phone as expected has heating issues,but the performance till now is kinda ok...bought this like 28 days ago..charger stopped working the day before yesterday itself...about the phone if you wanna know my feedback it is performing good for the things i use it for...i also play a game called free fire and it provides good sensitivity and touch responce as well...i play in standard and i see no lag even with screen rec on so it can allow you to do some good movements as well as headshots...but that stupid charger man..im pissed about that...please dont sell crappy side products...from some experience i saw that nobody gets a charger like the original one..please provide good side products too

 Not good performance facing over heating in Daily task in one day use and the camera is totally waste in this price of range other phones and facing drop frame of rate in playing video. Lots of bug facing in this phone
"

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

After lot of research and waiting for Scheme I finally purchased Redmi Note 10S, but due to some heating, charging issue in my received handset I had to returned it. Overall the mobile build quality was good and the phone was very much handy and look premium. I would have enjoyed if this issue would haven't exist. I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Really good phone.. Performance wise and back camera is awesome but the front camera is worst.. Not actually worst but decent in natural lighting condition but baddd in artificial light or low light.. And after the system update i feel like the camera quality has decreased even more and there is some system lag.. So redmi needs to fix this system update problem.. Overall i really like the phone performance wise and gaming experience is awesome!!

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"
14981,"
Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
14982,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

Dears, The mobile is handy but battery consumption to system app is more than other mobile. Installed alexa, it dried battery to 80percent in just 3 hrs. But charger works well. Amlod display is not upto the mark and consumes more battery. Sond effect without earphones is not so effective as expected. Other issue and pros will be shortly submitted.

Not much of a phone camera buff so can't comment on the camera quality. It's decent enough for my purpose but not good enough for social media posting.Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for  give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100.Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people.Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume.The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone ""head"" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.

Overall its a good device with good display, battery backup, camera. However, after couple of weeks of usage, I observed few issues:1. Display change its color (kind of night mode with yellow tint) at fixed time in evening and comes back to normal in the morning. Surprisingly, there is no option to enable/disable this feature. May be they will realise the bug and give option for user to configure according to choice.2. YouTube videos in the app as well as in the Chrome show flickering in the lower part of display. In chrome its more frequent.3. After 30-40 min of YouTube usage, app starts freezing videos. If we use frequent fast forward then it is freezing even in 15-20 mins. The only remedy to this is force close the app and open again.

OPTIMISED GAMING MODE.CAMERA - UNSATISFACTORY, NOT AS PER THE PRICE .DISPLAY - EXCELLENT WORK ON DISPLAY.NO LAG IN MOBILE WHEN USING SEVERAL APPS.

helio g95 SoC gives u good performance in pubg (upto smooth 60fps n UHD 40fps) but the main problem is excessive heating and significant frame drops. i would recommend to buy a phone cooler like vero forza artic pro is best under budget. and play games in AC room or cool places.all mi phones have problems with updates. problems after mi13 update are gyro slow response, front camers freeze, youtube freeze and earph notification always appearing at notification shade. fingerprint sensor simetimes doesn't work properly.about updates, before u update the device pls wait for few weeks and check out reviews about updates whether its safe or not.

Pros:1: Amoled display - I really like the display (coming from the realme narzo 30 pro which was an LCD display) I really like the black color which is really dark and actually black. On the narzo it becomes grey when your outdoora Or in the sunlight. Can't speak more on this cause this is my first AMOLED display that I'm using.2: Battery life(SOT): The phone with 100% charge, gives me a full day of usage. By end of the day I would be remaining with 56% (more of emails, calls, social media, music, YouTube and mordrate games). The highest screen on time I've got is more then 9hrs which is great!3: Build Quality:The device feels solid in your palm. It very think and light . Been using it without any case for more then a month now and no scratches on the ohone. The back is kind of a matte finish which leaves no fingerprints.4: Speaker: So apparently it has dual speakers, which is decent. Really loud when compared to most of the single module setup. It's very decent.Cons:1: Fast Charge: The 33w fast charge isn't fast. Which is a big disappointed for me coming from the narzo 30 pro which was super fast when compared to this, it was so convenient for me and my lifestyle which I don't get from the redmi 10s.2: The OS does feel glitchy at times when going from one app to another or certain notifications that are blank. Overall I feel they can fix these with updates but definitely not close to stock Android which is not the case in narzo 30 pro. Very leas bloatware compared to the 10s.3:Earpiece: I found this weird that i could hear more clear from behind the earpiece which is next to the camera. I found it hard to listen when on a call and I'd have to listen to the earpiece from the extreme top which is a werid position to speak in.Camera: It did not meet my expectations... For this price point you can't expect much. It does the job in certain areas like indoors but with light. It's not clear when you take a picture with less light. Outdoors it kind of over saturates the images and it's just not perfect but does the job in a very decent way.

Bad functionality & hence gave it a 3 star rating for the following reasons..1. Password lockscreen is too compact for the digits to be entered everytime. Attempting 4 times everytime, lol2. When it is sunny difficult to read the screen3. Even Samsung camera is all too good when compared to pictures shot with this4. Ph app updates sometimes clash with earlier versions for eg., clock. Don't know if android should be blamed or the Redmi ph updates 🤥 Hence i guess i had to make do with this for the cost @16000

Camera performance is just average because the reason isCamera is suddenly stopped when I click 10 or 15 minutesIts saw the device is too hotThat's why the device is very badAnd the second reason is youtube is suddenly strucked because i am watching the video with in five minutes atomatically.

Okay, Redmi note 10s is overall a good phone.  For people who needs a budget phone this is a good option.The manufacturing month of the phone is December 2021When I first turned on the phone , it seemed a bit slow.. After the initial set up and setting up google account, the UI stopped working. Got stuck for 1 minute literally..black screen.  Then I restarted it and updated the phone to MIUI 12.5.11 Stable. After that the phone is running smoothly. No lag. Nothing.You can uninstall several mi apps, otherwise you  need adb bloatware removal app. You can find videos on how to remove bloatwares in xiaomi phones in YouTube.Camera is good in this price range . I am not a photo Or selfie guy. It works for me.G95 processor  and its gpu is very good for gaming in medium settings.  I have played Call of duty mobile in medium settings and there was no noticeable drop in frame rates in multiplayer and BR. It was smooth.Wifi bluetooth and Proximity sensor are also working fine. No Issues.Brightness in outdoor is okayish.Overall the phone is fast after the update.The problems I found is1. YouTube videos are over contrasted and sharpened a bit. Watching YouTube videos suck in note 10s. When I looked for an answer, some one said in YouTube that it has to do with the g95 processor. I hope it will get resolved in next update. Videos on Amazon Prime and Netflix are fine.2. The screen flickered a lot. You can only observe it when you are in a dark room.It can be solved by going to developer options and disabling HW overlays. I will attach the screenshot.3. The display is not Super amoled as advertised in amazon. Just Amoled display. (Not a big problem)Overall the phone is pretty good. It has a good battery backup.I would suggest buying this phone for use as a secondary device .Not as a daily driver for watching videos and all.  It's a budget Smart phone.  G95 is an old chip. But a capable one.

This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

While this is an excellent value for money product, one thing every buyer should keep in mind the marketing gimmicks which phone companies do.My wife is using 2.5 years old Note 8 pro. It is going awesome. This phone (Note 10s) is just a slight upgrade over that phone. These companies do not launch new models. They just rebrand the old ones like old wine in new bottle and sell it to us. There is no difference in performance over its 2.5 years old counterpart.

The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.Average phone..

The phone is absolutely well designed for a normal hand fit the Pros are:1)the procecer is phenomenal at handling daily tasks and some light gaming does not hurt ither.2)the dual speaker are I dare say best in the segment they are crisp Anda have a small amount of bass the loudness is ample for a small room.3)the screen is 60hz so no super smooth display but the amoled is a big plus.Now to the cons:1)the battery does not have a lot to speak about got like 4.5 hrs of screen on time.2) the finger print placement is good and the finger print scanner is blazing fast but the accidental unlock 's is a big issue.3)the ui is fluid but the system has butt load of bloatware.Overall conclusion if your budget is around this price definitely go for this phone it's a solid overall package.

I got it for 11.7k during sale in October. 6/64gb.I have been using it since then, found these pros and cons.Pros -Good hardware (G95) at this price!Good fingerprint!Charging & battery life is ""Okay""!No major heating issue!Amoled screen is ""okay""!Cons-Dual speakers? Lol!Well, if right speaker has 1 watt, then left speaker has 0.5 watt!! i.e, upper speaker has less sound compared to down speaker. Thats not at all like dual speakers!Just for marketing they have mentioned as ""Dual speakers"".Super Amoled?Amazon must review this! They are marketing as ""Super Amoled"" but on the box, it's clearly mentioned just ""Amoled"".It's just basic Amoled!!Not good under sun light.. you know what! If you view any images of B&W, it's even worst under Sun light!! Yes, ""Worst""!4k video playing is not smooth, seen stutters.Camera! (pics attached) 64MP is a joke!It just adds more mb to a normal picture!! And when zoomed in, it's like ""OIL PAINTING"", not at all sharp! Lacks details in the image!Bokeh is not at all uniform!!Dynamic range? You can check it in the pic attached! It's same even for rear cam!Hair near ears and eyelashes gets ""kajal"" i.e black painted automatically!! That's very awkward!!Night mode the most useless feature of this cam dept!EMI works good. Slow motion, 960fps records only for 3sec and gives output video of 10seconds only! Almost useless!No option to record Slo-mo in 1080p even though this hardware supports!Supports only 720p 120fps & 240fps in Slo-mo.Bokeh does good job when captured with Gcam mod!!This is pure failure of MI/Redmi!Even though the hardware supports some very good features, the software  disappoints this piece!If you have purchased this, you can raise this issue to the MI customer care and you should email them with these issues to get it fixed.They must work on it!I have raised complaint, if it gets fixed, I'll update here.Till then, you may need to have a look on other products.

If you have low budget and wish to have android premium like phone this phone is for you.go for it .. Xiaomi is known as best smartphone producer in India and this phone proves it again .

1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.

Review after 4 months of using this phone -1. Finger print sensor doesn't work around 3-4 out of 10 times.2. Battery discharges within 5 hours of normal usage3. While playing WhatsApp audio, screen suddenly goes black, audio volume becomes negligible and phone gets rendered virtually useless for around 1-2 mins4. Can't record phone call without consent from other person (which violates the law)5. Both selfie and rear camera produce a despicable quality of images compared to Redmi Note 8 (which was legendary)6. Phone gets hung badly when using Google Chrome App (not sure if it's fault of app or phone)Advantage -1. AMOLED display (because everyone says so, although I really can't discern between AMOLED display of this phone and LCD display of Redmi Note 8)2. For the most part, touchscreen is really good (8/10 - because often I have experienced, to my utter dismay that it was not responding to light touches in certain parts of the screen whereas it should have)3. Even after considering all the aforementioned disadvantages - this phone is a blessing for low income people and one should definitely purchase it if one's budget is within 12k.

Yesterday i received it and camera is really good according to its price. Deep blue sea color is best for me. I am not a gamer so the performance for me is fine. Display is good. I hate miui but this time hardware and software worthy of it.I got it this device under 12000. You should buy this phone. Trust me there is no phone which camera is better in this price even 15000rs phones are feel cheap in quality. Even i also have OnePlus nord ce, ce 2 and lite but trust me. There is nothing special anymore about OnePlus.

I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers 🔊.  Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.

 Phone has a great spec. I was looking for real 8Gig RAM phone under 15k segment. Got 8+4(Virtual) RAM. 128 G memory. Decent camera. solid Battery, takes only 30-40% battery on heavy use. Compared to my current phone Pro Max came weight is lighter.. Able to hold hoe long hours with good pop ups... Overall 7/10...

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect i phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and gettung to play bgmi with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.

I have always had a good experience with the Xiaomi products. This is my 3rd MI phone in the past 7 years. They work well and are value for money. If you are looking for a good phone in a reasonable price range- this one tops it. The camera works well. Features are good and updated and phone has a good quality.reviewing after using for 2 months :)

On paper, this phone looks quite impressing.But in reality, it failed to impress me. Here is my review about the Redmi note 10S(6gb+64gb).Pros:1) redmi phones are known for packing the highest possible quality hardware.2) deep sea blue colour is very charming.3) dual speakers (one on the top and another on the downside).4) 3.5mm jack on the downside.5) above average battery life.Cons:-1) pathetic software (miui should better die now)2) when i applied several settings, phone hangs. And you have to restart the phone for applying that setting.( Even after installing the 350mb update available as you set up the phone).3) phone had to be adjusted around the ear to hear the voice clearly.4) camera quality is poor. (Inbuilt camera app is the culprit; go for third party app instead)5) fingerprint scanner is very slow (miui is the culprit; wait for the new update from Mi)6) display quality is notthat good as hyped by Mi. Although, it is an super amolded display, but i think LCD displays are better than this in this price segment.7) finger print scanner is convex shaped. I think the concave ones are better.8) while setting up the phone, be cautious; otherwise you can attract advertisements. ""Mi glance"" option must be set off while setting up the phone for the very first time.Conclusively, hardware is very good; software is the villain. Go for realme 8i or install custom rom (if you are a techie and dont care for the warranty).

One of the best budget device one can ask for if they are looking for a device which can handle day-to-day tasks and a bit of gaming.Helio G95 is a very capable processor for the given price bracket. It handles BGMI and other games pretty well. I benchmarked the device with Antutu and got a score of around 330k which is very decent.Camera quality is not excellent but a little better than the average. It gets the job done.Battery life is excellent (with always on display enabled) & also the battery charges pretty quickly thanks to the 33W charger.Stereo speakers are the cherry on the top. The sound quality is crisp and loud.Couldn't ask anything more in the given price bracket. Very happy with purchase.

Mobile is good as always.. worthy for money, guys pls be noted, there is no MIUI contact and phone dialer, from redmi 10 series they have removed it. you cannot expect the same redmi apps, call recorder option with google dialer comes with a note, stupid thing. i have read reviews here, none mentioned abt that. so i am mentioning this, you will not be satisfied without MIUI contact and phone dialer, so if your a person of it, then go to oppo or vivo models. camera quality is not that good, not a 5star product.

Redmi note 10S cosmic purple color I bought from Amazon. Phone packing and delivery is good. But phone camara is very poor for this budget. It is my honest opinion. You can definitely go for other companies like samsung for best camera. Because in my opinion Redmi phones are good in fast charging, display quality but it is bad when we talk about camera ( The problems are over contrast , no smooth edge and not that much clarity at 64mp back camera & Front camera is very bad ie:16mp). And also some heating compared to other devices. I purchased this phone based on popular youtube channel videos. But it is not that much worth for money. So I returns it and got my money back ( Thank you Amazon for return my cash back). Most of them comment like samsung phones are nowadays stuck in performance wise but my opinion is their software update and optimizations are better compared to China brands except higher range mobile phones. But they provide less watt charger but it is ok. And finally you can go for other phones for this budget like M32 or other companies. If you opt for more money then purchase best mobile phones based on the most of the product review.

We're INDIAN, we will never purchase such phones where we need to purchase Charging adapter separately, they are fooling us, they are making a very big amount of money by remove charger from the package, this review not for this (redmi note 10) mobile but other company like Samsung, apple etc. They creating this strategy to make max profit. Don't buy them.This product Is very good I purchased it by it's in box accessories but the phone is too good but I have only one problem in this phone it heat too much. But work properly. I'm satisfied.

This phone caters the need of most buyers. I bought it for my dad and he seems to be okay with the usage. Neither he is crazy for games nor he intends to use it for high end apps. Just multimedia consumption and bit of business whatsapp is all he needs. And this phone ticks all the boxes. Good display, awesome sound (too loud for my taste though), and decent battery life with good charging capabilities.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

I am using this phone for almost two to three months. In my opinion this is the best phone I can get on this budget. Before buying this phone I checked all the comments and there was a lot of bad reviews about this phone. After using this, in my experience it is not that bad as they say.NB:: I AM NOT A GAMER.1.Battery: battery life is excellent if you are keeping it in dark mode and less brightness you will get excellent backup.2.Camera:. Camera quality is ok not the best but for me it is satisfying. I am happy with the quality this is giving.3. Heating:  there is a little heating . but when you check the YouTube videos of other phones every phone has heating issue. This heating issue is only for heavy gamers.SO IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR DAY TO DAY USE LIKE YOUTUBE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM ETC...THIS PHONE IS BEST, I HAVE NO ISSUES SO FAR NO HANGING PROBLEMS.**And one more thing do not update.

If you're looking for a performance based phone under 15k,( although i bought it at 12k) then you should definitely go for it. Here's why:-It provides smooth 60 fps by default!(on BGMI) I've been using using this device for a couple of months and i hardly notice any frame drops. Also you can play BGMI on HDR with Ultra frame rate, and even tho its frame rate limit is ultra on HDR, it provides 47-58fps on HDR, yes. I've been playing BGMI on this phone for a couple of months, it still lets me play on HDR with an average of 55fps!! And its still a 15k phone!!! Although it heats up after playing continuously for 4-5 hours, you should probably go for it guys.

This is by far the best phone in this price range.The Amoled display is good and vibrant.Rest all the reviews you will find on youtube so ill keep things short and pinpoint several things which reviewers dont consider sharing1. MiUi needs to be worked on it doesnt make full use of the phone's potential.2. The annoying pre loaded apps are good but you can not uninstall some of it like GetApps, wallpaper crousel.3. It does collects data from msa, and all the pre installed apps even though its made in India it still steals your data so do know that it is somewhat helping and paying China.4. To fix Ads issue and recommendations you need to turn it off from every single xiaomi apps settings.5. Cant uninstall xiaomi apps, only can disable and the procedure is very tiring.6. Flash has only white light no yellow tone secondary light and is still very dim.7. Secondary speaker sounds a bit low and its same as the earpiece speaker.But for this price range these are the things you can ignore as it still does things better than other phones in this price range also these are mostly just software bugs. Hardware wise this device is very solid.

Very good hardware let down by miui 12.5 which is riddled with serious bugs. Especially display freezing at night is annoying, always on display also freezes the screen at night.. Dual apps can't send sms and UPI is not usable because of this issue which is a major major problem.. Buggy software.. Extremely slow fingerprint reading at times. Selfie camera is worst at night. Phone app is also very slow, call screen takes pauses before appearing.. Second space makes the phone even more slow and buggy. Xiaomi has given miui updates but every update introduces some kind of bugs. The fact that this model is now 6 months old and yet xiaomi is not able to resolve the bugs.Display is just superb.. AMOLED is a huge advantage over LCD. Colors are accurate, sunlight legibility is very very good. Phone is very light weight and thin. Charging is pretty fast too.. Dual stereo speakers are really good.Overall waste of a money because of long pending software issues.. Realme UI on my narzo 50 is quite fluid and bugless in my opinion..

I haven't found any heating and hanging issues yet.I am having only one problem.There is vibration at the time of typing. I can't find the option to turn it off.you can go for it. I bought this phone in 12999 rupees in offer period with cash on delivery. Thanks seller, thanks Amazon.

Other party can't hear few sentences in between a conversation. Its a pain to say the least. It also loses connection while playing online chess. I think the wifi chip is faulty in my handset. Going to support center and coming back would cost me 600 (since atleast two times you have to visit to collect it back).Maybe i will sell it and get a new device since the price has come down.

Camera is below average, slowness and lag observed in normal operations.
"

I think the quality has been compromised on quantity. It lags even in those games that run smoothly in redmi note 3. Hence instead of upgrading redmi is downgrading it's quality.  Not worth it's value.
"
15558,"
Best in this price range display is also good but camera quality is just ok battery backup is also decent speaker is also loud and clear. Sometimes blue light around the screen when I receive notification I think this is a defect many users experience this problem. If you want camera phone don't buy this. I  give four 🌟 because I receive AMOLED SCREEN and nice processor and RAM at this price range.I bought this in 12999 rupees

I want to you tell one thing Xiaomi is doing good but the UI of this phone is very irritating there is so many bugs whenever I open the camera of this phone it is taking more time to launch the camera, otherwise phone is excellent
"
15562,"
Battery is draining much faster than expected.with in 5 hours usage the mobile will shutdown due to low battery
"
15563,"
The phone overall is good in terms of performance and camera quality. Also the display is good as i is amoled which i usually like in smartphones. But the fingerprint is quiet annoying even if i just only want to check the time it unlocks itself and yeah the sensory is annoying as it has virtual sensor and during calling it sometime mutes itself i guess all new phones have that which is frustrating.

This phone have major screen Flickering issues, if you are using specs for your eyes or not it's better to avoid buying this or any other amoled display phone as it harms our eyes. Apart from this everything is great in this phone. For me the display was a major concern so I mentioned but if you can neglect this issue or you are okay with this that you can buy without any second thought.

Good phone but according to price segment it's costly. Camera quality very poor at indor. Sky portions also show white when you click trees . Less focus. Outside picture quality is good but background portions shows colourless cloud show like as whiteboard. No difference between cloud and sky. Both are shown white.battery backup is normal . Performance are also normal. One and only best that phone is thin and easy handling.
"

Display: Good Amoled display. Clarity is good. But when I play YouTube video on 360p or 480p, video contrast get busted. Very bad experience at that time. Hd, full hd , 2k video plays very smooth and good colour , contrast.Camera: Nice camera according to price range. No issueBattery: Excellent battery backup. My use is very normal like 12 hr hotspot active, YouTube, normal calls and I got 2 days battery backup. Almost 10hrs screen on time.Speaker: Good sound quality but bass is low. Acceptable according to price.Network: Good network strength and no issue with network. 4g plus supported.Ads: No ads when u disable all recommended settings for ads.Haptic feedback: Typing is good but back pannel vibrate a lot because of plastic back.Overall good package phone if you are watching movie and video a lot. Battery backup excellent. Camera is good. Speaker also done their job. Display size is good enough. Not recommended for heavy gaming.

Everything is tooooo good except camera ,, camera is good in outdoor condition and i loved  the display
"
15622,"
Not very good product. As sound quality is worse.
"
15623,"
so lets start with the prospros:1.SAmoled display is just so good, i would prefer 60hz amoled display over 90hz normal display anytime.2. slim design and good in hand feel.3.camera is also good.4.it is a punch hole display and the chin is also small.cons:1.heats too much while gaming but not while normal use, so this is not for gamers even having a good processor.2.It has some focus issue, and the selfie camera is not as good as it should be.conclusion: So if you're buying this for content consumption then go for it this is the best for that purpose. But if you cant game on this device its gets too hot, go for any other smartphone for gaming but do check there reviews..

15631,"
The phone looks amazing in cosmic purple. It's feels good to handle feels so slim in the hand. It's been a week since I've been using the phone The camera is good for the price range. Overall the phone good to use. Battery life is good too last for a day and half with moderate use. I'm not a gamer so don't really know how much it would last if games are played. The UI also is good with lots of features. Overall a good phone for the budget.
"
15632,"
I must say that it's one of the tremendous and stunning phones that are available under the price of 15000. It has a splendid display and the quality of the display was flawless and immaculate, furthermore, the camera, battery, fast charging facility are more perfect than I thought and only one drawback is that it doesn't have 5G . But If you are person who doesn't consider buying a 5G phone and want more features, such as Amoled display, better processor, nice camera, good looking, you can undoubtedly buy this phone without hesitation.
"
15633,"
Awesome  mobile
"

Weightless. Good for single hand usage. Performance and battery life was also good. Problem starts in Video quality. Watching YouTube videos wih 480p resolution was of bad quality. Only at 1080p its good to watch. Kindly consider the video quality before buying. Other than that it is good.

This device is perfect for day to day usage.Had no problems in thatPlayed Free fire max and Bgmi and the games were running smoothly.Although the device heats but it performs good in cold or moderate environment.Camera performance is satisfactory.
"

i can't go in much detail since most things seem fine to me , just the fingerprint sensor isn't that good, and the camera isn't to rave about either.
"
15679,"
I would like to give 0 star to delivery team, they took 2 weeks to deliver the product, simply pathetic and amazon service is also not good. They are not able to help you in case of any issue and this has happened twice with me, pathetic service from amazon. Overall 3.5 stars to phone. Camera is not that good, screen is amoled and is crystal clear, you can play heavy graphics game without any issue, works very well.

It is a wonderful phone with stereo speakers and AMOLED display is something you are going to fall in love with. But camera quality is too bad as it is a disrespect for 64MP camera 😀 as they claim. Its camera is only 2MP only in real terms. One more issue with Xiaomi phone is its ""couldn't activate sim..."" notifications.
"
15691,"
I bought 6+64 GB version during republic day saleNormal selling price  is ₹14999.During sale it was ₹13999+₹1000 SBI card discount.So effective price was ₹13000..in this price it was great deal
"

Phone performance is good. Fingure print sensor working excellent. Battery backup and fast charging working fine. For people looking for good camera in phone this phone is totally not preferred. Overall phone is good but redmi could have done better with the cameras.

I am using this phone from last two days first of all thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. I likes the fingerprints, face lock,speed, is superb…👍 and the value of money is also very good because I got exchange and icici card  two offers and reduced almost rs. 3100/- now only two dislikes one is camera quality at night and the sound is not that much satisfaction…. But overall this is superb product..Thanks.

Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product  I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...

Value for money but fingerprint scanner position is terrible, camera is poor quality, batter life is decent, size is a big too big, front camera is useless since a circular light from phone is see in every pic as camera is in the center of the screen. Needs a little buffer between camera's circumference and the screen.

I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.

This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.My product is under warranty period, I Called to Customer Support Services but they misguide me again and again. I visited four time to MI Services Centre, (Jyoti Mobile, Kaithal-136027) but they also misguide me, they updated software in my phone but problem remain same. 10 days ago, they asked to call me but still no any call me from their side

This model has a little problem of screen flickering sometimes. I have replaced the set but same problem is in the second set. Then I'm using the second one. Don't know the problem may be big issue in future. The dialer is Google dialer that I don't like because it's recording feature. Mi dialer or samsung dialer is fulfilled the recording feature. Others are ok.

Some features are really amazing - the fingerprint sensor, the design, the look.My only grudge is the design decision to not show any notifications. Earlier phones used to have a light that blinked, indicating there are unread notifications. Not in this phone, or the new Redmi series itself.Except for that - the phone has some excellent features and apps. Worth going for to experience a luxury feel in a decent budget.

It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range.
"
15809,"
Well done phone

Fingerprint reader is little slow,Battery life is good.Camera is V. Good

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more
"
15814,"
Have faced lot of issues with the MIUI 12.5 OS that comes preloaded - the network fails automatically, lots of bloatware getting installed without my permission even after I uninstall them. Camera quality is also average considering other options at this price range. Dual speakers works well and is decently loud.

I would like to rate this phone a 5/10 points because it has not been able to reach my expectations . There were many problems I faced after I bought this phone the first issue I faced was I was unable to save any of the new contacts  , second  issue is that the phone's battery isn't living upto the adverse, it heats up at a fast rate of speed (apps not used more than 2-3) . The other problem there is a lot of bugs and fixes on this phone for gallery, contacts, and every other media and apps this phone is holding.Please choose wisely and buy. Use reference from the given ratingsCamera 8/10  , battery 5/10  , screen 8/10 , storage 9/10  , processor 4/10. I hope this review is helpful for those who are buying redmi note 10s .  Thank you

The product i received is almost the used and repacked. Anyone can easily sense that. I would suggest not to buy these old smartphones from the online platform. Mostly these are from old stock and used for the demo at the counter by individual seller. I received this from Pimpri Pune seller.Talking about smartphones, i was expecting way more and it's not at all upto the mark. Built-in Alexa has some glitches. Battery is very poor. Not sure if I'm only facing this issue.After restarting the phone random application shortcut are getting created for no reason. Need to be fixed.Fast charging is the only plus side of the phone, it works really well. Sound quality is also good. Speakers are adequately loud.Overall I'm disappointed.

Fingerprint placing is very bad and not working as per expected. Whenever any incoming call ringing, always phone ringing is accurate but whose calling on display is very late... So it's very irritating... According to other mobiles in same price segment it's a very bad choice according to me.. Go with realme instead of this as per me... After using this from last almost 30 days i think it's average product. And I don't suggest anyone for this...

This phone is a perfect allrounder...Believe me...The display is amoled and good...You can get better diplay on Samsung but samsung lacks performance...The g95 is a good chip ...You can play intense games for long hours without thinking about battery.just keep one thing in mind that the processor heats up..so if u play in cool room then no problem will be there...the cameras are very good but the processing software is not good.so I use Google camera mod..Battery life is amazing with 50 charge in nearly half hour...They design is very compact and feels great to hold...This is the best design in this price segment...Dual speakers do the job and the phone is dust and water resistant...u can use in rain...The fingerprint sensor is very good indeed...Just to sum it up....If u can keep the device cool all the time...Then it is the best deal in 15000 with 4 yrs of security updates..

I have now purchased Redmi Note 10 pro hope this time all work fine.

Those who are thinking that this is not a gaming phone or it will lag after some time, these are fake information this phone is over all a good combination of processor and battery life, supports high graphics and battery will be drained if someone play with ultra graphics mode. Camera quality is good enough, though it can be great. Thanks amazon for this beautiful product. Customer like us always expect a good deal, and you guys always come up with some good ones.

Wanted a phone with good specs in decent price, without compromising quality. Initially it was out of stock but ordered it as soon as it came out. Haven't seen better prices anywhere else. Plus I exchanged my old phone for a discount at a good rate at Amazon without any hassle. Good deal for an excelent phonr. . Camera is good and 6gb works well. Been 2 months now and no issues so far.

So I was so nervous about buying this phone, actually 80% of the comments here are negatives about this beautiful and powerful cellphone. Don't know whether the people knew how to review a phone or not.One of the most important thing about Phone's camera. Camera is quite good in this price range. Not best, but quite good.Also MI has service centres all over the India so you wouldn't feel any hesitation or problem in after sales service.A good buy, if anyone wants to go with this phone they can go with this.

the only thing which is good is its sterio dual speaker and light wt. of mobile , except this nothing is good.for gaming of 1-2 hour continueous is too dangerous mobile got extreme heat.camera quality is average.display quality is not much better, better than fhd+ but not like other s- amoled.charging time is 1hr 15 min if not used during charging,if you use mobile during charging it take 2+ hour.overall , agood phone for study and normal use but u can go for 5g phone in this range if u want to take for future next 2-3 year

Please don't buy this product. And there is you tube lag issue ,even it was reported across all channels. Had connected with redmi support team and their resolution steps didn't work out.It look like, wasted money by purchasing this product. Very surprised, RAM -8 GB and company declared as this is gaming mobile. This mobile performance is so bad, I couldn't imagine this experience. Hello Amazon, if possible, please ban this particular products from your bucket. If possible, please convey the same to redmi company.

Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
"

Front Camera is extremely poor, never expected such a waste camera from Xiaomi. My Redmi Note 5 Pro n Techno Spark 7T captures better pictures than this. Google dialer freezes a lot while dialing numbers, it is not 100% optimized with device. I replaced the device but still no improvement. MIUI Stock Call recording feature is gone, now it announces that ""Call is being recorded"", every time you record a call.Multimedia consumption, fast charging & performance is good and battery life is average.Advice: Don't buy this device if your main objective is Camera and better battery life.
"
15982,"
""BIG NO"" FOR THIS PRODUCT AND VENDOR1:) Once on call you wan't hear the voice properly.2:) Even the volume is not upto the mark.3:) Not worth the price and the specification except the storage which is a + here.4:) Feel cheated after 15 days post my purchase.5:) Quality of Speakers seems quiet faded and bad, regret my choice of this product.6:) Notifications always capture entire screen at every instant leading to inconvenience while doing or performing any thing on the screen.
"

If you wish a best camera mobile don't choose this one. Not up to the mark. Don't know why this costly for poor camera features. To be honest I am not satisfied at all. Disappointed...

I got my mobile delivered yesterday.I bought it to gift to my dad on his birthday.I was expecting a good quality screen as they said it's AMOLED. But really disappointed.It's not even as normal LED screen.Camera quality is very poor.Selfie camera is horrible. Camera hangs a lot during captureBattery utilisation is too much with normal usageAnd I don't see that great charging with the given adaptor as said in the reviews and description.With no memory filling, the phone started hanging.not sure how it works in future.Overall, I'm disappointed with the phone

Redmi 10S मोबाइल फोन बहुत ही हैंग हो रहा है, वीडियो चलाने पर वीडियो प्ले नही होती, app ओपन नहीं होते और भी बहुत सी प्रॉब्लम को इस हैंडसेट के साथ फेस कर रहे हैं। आप सभी को में यही सुझाव दूंगा की इस सेट को ना खरीदें।

Dears, The mobile is handy but battery consumption to system app is more than other mobile. Installed alexa, it dried battery to 80percent in just 3 hrs. But charger works well. Amlod display is not upto the mark and consumes more battery. Sond effect without earphones is not so effective as expected. Other issue and pros will be shortly submitted.
